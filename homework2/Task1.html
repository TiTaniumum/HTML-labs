    <h1 class="style1">Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h3 class="style2">ACT 1</h3>
    <h3 class="style2">PROLOGUE</h3>
    <p class="style3">
        Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
        From ancient goudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; <br>
        Whose misadventured piteaous overthrows <br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, <br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br>
        Which but their children's end, nought could remove, <br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br>
        The which if you with parient ears attend, <br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. <br>
        <br>
